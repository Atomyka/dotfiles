Here are some of my software development configurations.
They are all in their original file formats as I want them to be short, simple and easy to refer to. Enjoy!

## Configurations For:
1. Vim (`.vimrc`)
2. Bash (`.bashrc`)
3. Zsh (`.zshrc`)
4. Tmux (`.tmux.conf`)
5. Git (`.gitconfig`)
6. Alacritty (`alacritty.yml`)
7. `.Xmodmap` - swaps Control and Caps Lock keys
